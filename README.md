#### Teamaufgabe in Java

NOTE: This project is part of the Business Informatics Bachelor at the TU Wien and is aimed towards learning to handle multidimensional Data in Java. 

Given is a file junctions.csv which contains the names and coordinates from real Trainstations & Airports all over the world. 

The programm reads the data from the file and stores it, due to demonstration purposes, in two different datastructures:
1. A [naive ArrayList](src/NaiveList.java) (inefficient) 
2. [2D Grid] (src/Grid.java) (efficient)
